In the demanding context of college life, students frequently encounter difficulties in maintaining essential well-being practices, such as ensuring sufficient sleep, staying hydrated, and incorporating regular meditation. The demanding schedule of classes, intense study sessions, and the delicate balance between academic and social commitments often lead to neglecting these vital health needs.

Acknowledging that adequate sleep, hydration, and meditation form the cornerstone of optimal performance, personal development, and effective learning, this project aims to tackle the prevalent challenges faced by students. Ignoring these basic requirements can lead to various obstacles, including persistent tiredness, heightened stress levels, and vulnerability to issues like depression and burnout. Despite the availability of water refill stations on campus, students sometimes struggle to locate them and end up waiting until they return home to hydrate. This project seeks to address this issue by providing a convenient solution to locate and access these water refill stations on campus, including recommending the nearest one based on the student's current location via their smartphone. We will also implement the functionality to the app which will be able to locate all the nearest water refilling stations on the campus. Similar to the app functionality of the Zotfinder, we will implement a section that will open up a map-like interface in which we will guide the students to the nearest water station. This will try and help solve the problem of students who donâ€™t hydrate themselves enough throughout the day.

In terms of meditation and sleep, the application will incorporate a Sleep Reminder feature designed to alert users to initiate their bedtime routine precisely 9 hours and 15 minutes prior to their intended waking time. Additionally, it will remind them to steer clear of electronic devices for at least an hour before going to bed. Leveraging the Sleep API, the app will monitor sleep patterns and gather user feedback to tailor the wake-up algorithm accordingly. Key milestones in the development process encompass feature conceptualization, UI design, and seamless integration of the Sleep API. Furthermore, the application will gather heartbeat data from compatible smartwatches to enhance its functionality.
